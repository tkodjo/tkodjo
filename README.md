👋 Welcome to Kodjo TCHIOFFO's GitHub!  

## About Me  
I'm Kodjo TCHIOFFO, a **Global Affairs Analyst** and **Information Systems Engineer** with decades of experience at the crossroads of **technology, governance, and diplomacy** in high-stakes global environments.  
My expertise lies in **cloud computing, big data analytics, NLP, and complex systems**, with a focus on harnessing unstructured information and discourse into **actionable intelligence** for global policy and decision-making.  


I thrive in **stochastic, risk-averse contexts**, applying **cross-disciplinary expertise** to address complex global challenges in an age where diplomacy meets computational and multi agent systems.  

## What I Do  
💡 Bridge **machine learning, NLP, and computational diplomacy** to design solutions for global governance.  
🔧 Architect **cloud-native applications** (AWS, Azure, Kubernetes) and resilient **data pipelines**.  
🌐 Apply **NLP to diplomacy**, analyzing treaties, communiqués, and legal instruments for tone, intent, and meaning.  
📊 Develop **data-driven policy frameworks** grounded in complex systems analysis.  
🛰️ Explore **IoT, spectrum management, and satellite-enabled systems** for governance.  

## Side Projects  

### 🛰️ Measuring Diplomatic Intent and Tone (DITS)  
- Developing the **DITS: Diplomatic Intent and Tone Scale**, a framework to systematically measure tone and intent in multilateral discourse.  
- Applying **NLP sentiment analysis** and computational linguistics to United Nations Security Council and African Union Peace and Security Council communiqués.  
- Translating diplomatic language into **policy-relevant signals**, supporting negotiation strategies and governance decisions.  
- Prototyping dashboards for **real-time monitoring** of diplomatic discourse dynamics.

### ☁️ Complex Systems in Global Governance  
- Creating **cloud-based architectures** for analyzing entangled system dynamics in uncertain environments.  
- Integrating **IoT and geopolitical data streams** for resilience modeling and scenario analysis.

### 🔧 Quality Assurance Workflows in SDLC  
- Designing **DevOps-driven quality assurance CI/CD pipelines** for end-to-end software delivery.  
- Implementing **automated E2E testing** of multi-tier software bricks across distributed environments.
- Ensuring **reliability, scalability, and resilience** of applications in mission-critical contexts through continuous validation. 

## Let's Collaborate!  
I’m passionate about developing **tools that merge AI, NLP, and governance**. If you’re working on **computational diplomacy, global systems modeling, or policy tech**, let’s connect.
